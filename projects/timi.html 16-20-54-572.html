                    <p>
                        <strong>Timi.ai</strong> is an educational real-time agent that leverages the prodigy effect—a phenomenon showing that teaching others actually leads to better learning outcomes for the teacher. By flipping the traditional educational paradigm, Timi.ai helps students learn more effectively by placing them in the role of teacher to an AI.

                    <h2>The Prodigy Effect</h2>
                    <p>
                        The prodigy effect (also known as the "protégé effect") is a psychological phenomenon where teaching or explaining concepts to others improves one's own understanding. Research has shown that students who teach material to others:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Develop a deeper understanding of the subject matter</li>
                        <li>Retain information longer</li>
                        <li>Identify gaps in their own knowledge</li>
                        <li>Engage in more metacognitive processing</li>
                        <li>Experience higher motivation and emotional investment in the material</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Timi.ai harnesses this effect by creating an AI student that convincingly simulates the learning process, asking questions, expressing confusion, and requiring clarification—all prompting the human student to strengthen their understanding through teaching.

                        The system uses advanced large language models (LLMs) to create believable AI personas with distinct roles in the educational process. The AI student is designed to express curiosity, ask challenging questions, and occasionally misunderstand concepts—creating authentic teaching moments. Meanwhile, the AI teacher serves as a facilitator and knowledge validator when needed.

                        Timi.ai was developed as part of an OpenAI hackathon organized by AI Tinkerers. The competition challenged participants to create innovative educational applications using large language models. Our team's focus on the prodigy effect offered a fresh perspective on AI-assisted learning, moving beyond conventional tutoring models to position AI as both student and facilitator.

                    <p>
                        Early testing with Timi.ai has demonstrated several key benefits for learners:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Improved Comprehension:</strong> Students show deeper understanding of subjects after explaining them to the AI student</li>
                        <li><strong>Enhanced Retention:</strong> Teaching concepts to the AI leads to better long-term recall</li>
                        <li><strong>Knowledge Gap Identification:</strong> Students discover what they don't fully understand when trying to teach it</li>
                        <li><strong>Confidence Building:</strong> The teaching role increases student confidence in their knowledge</li>
                        <li><strong>Engagement:</strong> The interactive nature of the system maintains higher levels of engagement compared to passive learning</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>
                        The system has been particularly effective for abstract concepts that benefit from verbalization and explanation, as well as for learners who struggle in traditional educational settings.
