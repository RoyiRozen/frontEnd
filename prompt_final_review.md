# Final Review: Ensuring Consistency and "ARTour" Feel Across All Projects

Once you have applied the 'Detailed Guide for Revising Individual Project Pages' to all your projects, this final review step will help ensure consistency and the desired 'ARTour' aesthetic across your entire portfolio.

1.  **Consistency Check:**
    *   **Action:** Open each project page one after another.
    *   **Look for:**
        *   **Layout:** Does the general structure (video, brief, 3-4 sections) feel consistent?
        *   **Formatting:** Are headings, text, bullet points, and image placements handled similarly?
        *   **Image Style:** While images will differ, does the overall quality and presentation style feel harmonious?
        *   **Tone of Voice:** Is the language used across projects professional and consistent?
    *   **Goal:** While each project is unique, the overall user experience of navigating from one project to another should feel seamless and familiar.

2.  **"ARTour" Aesthetic Alignment:**
    *   **Action:** Revisit the `projects/artour.html` page (even after its own revision based on the new template). Compare its overall clean, structured, and professional feel to your other revised project pages.
    *   **Consider:**
        *   **Whitespace:** Is there enough whitespace to prevent pages from feeling cluttered?
        *   **Typography:** Are fonts clear, readable, and used consistently?
        *   **Visual Hierarchy:** Is it easy to distinguish between titles, headings, and body text?
    *   **Goal:** All project pages should evoke that same sense of "tidiness" and clarity mentioned in the feedback.

3.  **Impact and Conciseness Review:**
    *   **Action:** For each project, quickly skim through it as if you were a busy recruiter or visitor.
    *   **Ask yourself:**
        *   Can I understand the project's essence in 1-2 minutes?
        *   Are the key takeaways and your contributions clear?
        *   Is it image/graphic forward, as requested?
    *   **Goal:** Ensure that the focus on brevity and visual impact has been successfully implemented on every page.

4.  **Navigation and Links:**
    *   **Action:** Double-check all navigation links:
        *   'Back to Portfolio' links on project pages.
        *   Any internal links within project pages (if any).
        *   Links to live demos or external resources.
    *   **Goal:** A smooth and error-free navigation experience.

**End Goal:** A polished and cohesive portfolio where every project page is concise, visually engaging, easy to understand, and reflects the desired 'ARTour' quality, creating a strong overall impression.
