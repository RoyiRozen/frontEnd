# General Portfolio Page Review (`index.html`)

This prompt will help you refine the main page of your portfolio (`index.html`) to ensure it's clean, focused, and effectively showcases your projects.

1.  **Review Project Grid:**
    *   Examine the current project grid (where all your projects are listed).
    *   **Goal:** Ensure it's visually clear, easy to scan, and appealing.
    *   **Action:** Check for consistent image aspect ratios for project thumbnails. Ensure project titles and short descriptions are concise. Verify that the filtering and column toggle options are working as expected and contribute positively to the user experience.

2.  **Assess Header and Navigation:**
    *   Look at the header section (name, resume, about, LinkedIn).
    *   **Goal:** Ensure it's clean and provides essential navigation without being cluttered.
    *   **Action:** Confirm that links are working. The current layout seems fine, but ensure it aligns with the overall tidier feel you're aiming for.

3.  **Evaluate Additional Sections (e.g., Video Slider, 'Random Dog Image'):**
    *   You currently have a video slider section and a 'random dog image' feature on your main page.
    *   **Goal:** Determine if these sections add significant value to your portfolio's primary goal (showcasing your work) or if they might be distracting.
    *   **Action:**
        *   Consider the feedback: "Biggest take away should be that people may spend a min or two max reading each project." Does seeing a video slider or fetching a dog image on the *main landing page* help them get to your projects faster?
        *   If these sections are not critical for a first impression, consider:
            *   Moving them to the 'About' page or a dedicated 'Fun Stuff' or 'Experiments' section.
            *   Removing them if they don't align with the professional image you want to project.
        *   The aim is to make the path to your project details as direct and uncluttered as possible.

4.  **Overall Impression:**
    *   **Goal:** The main page should feel cohesive with the 'ARTour' aesthetic (clean, structured, professional) you're aiming for in your project pages.
    *   **Action:** Step back and look at the page as a whole. Does it guide visitors effectively to your best work? Is it too busy?

**End Goal:** A streamlined `index.html` that primarily serves to get visitors interested in, and navigating to, your individual project pages.
