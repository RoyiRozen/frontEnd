# Detailed Guide for Revising Individual Project Pages

This template will guide you through restructuring and refining each of your individual project pages to align with the feedback you received. The goal is a consistent, clean, and impactful presentation for every project, much like the preferred 'ARTour' style, but even more concise and focused.

**Apply these steps to EACH project page:**

1.  **Project Title & Tags:**
    *   Ensure the project title is clear and prominent at the top of the page.
    *   Include relevant tags (e.g., AR, UI/UX, Product) directly under or next to the title for quick context.

2.  **Lead with a "Big Video":**
    *   **Action:** Immediately after the title and tags, embed the most impactful video showcasing this project.
    *   **Goal:** Grab attention instantly. Make it large and auto-playing (muted loop is often best for background/hero videos).
    *   *(Refer to `artour.html` for an example of video placement, but ensure your video is given more prominence if possible).*

3.  **Short Project Brief:**
    *   **Action:** Following the video, write a concise project brief.
    *   **Content:** 1-2 short paragraphs that summarize:
        *   What the project is.
        *   The problem it solves or the experience it offers.
        *   Your role in the project.
    *   **Goal:** Give a quick, high-level understanding.

4.  **Consolidate into 3-4 Key Sections MAX:**
    *   **Action:** Review all current content for this project. Identify 3-4 *most important* aspects to highlight.
    *   **Examples of section topics:** "Key Features," "Design Process," "Technical Challenges," "User Interface Highlights," "Project Impact," "My Contribution." Choose what best tells the story of *this specific* project.
    *   **Goal:** Keep it brief and focused. Avoid overwhelming the visitor.

5.  **Structure for Each of the 3-4 Sections:**
    *   **Clear Topic Heading:** Use a descriptive heading for each section.
    *   **Concise Content:**
        *   1 short paragraph OR
        *   A small list of bullet points (3-5 bullets maximum).
        *   **Focus on achievements and outcomes.**
    *   **One Key Image/Graphic per Section:**
        *   Accompany the text with *one* relevant, high-quality image or graphic. This image should directly support the text in that section.
        *   **Avoid:** Multiple small images clustered together for a single point.
    *   **IMPORTANT - Replacing "Bounded Icon Blocks":**
        *   The feedback was to "cut down on all of these bounded icon blocks." This refers to sections where multiple features, tech stack items, or process steps are each in their own styled box with an icon (like the 'Key Features' or 'Technical Implementation' in the current `artour.html` or `medcomm.html`).
        *   **Instead of this:**
            *   If listing features: Use a simple bullet list within one of your 3-4 main sections, accompanied by *one overall illustrative image* for that feature set.
            *   If listing tech stack: Briefly mention key technologies in a paragraph or a short bullet list within a relevant section (e.g., "Development Insights" or "Technical Overview"). Avoid individual icons/boxes for each technology.
            *   The goal is a cleaner, less cluttered look that relies on strong primary images and concise text.

6.  **Image Optimization & Consistency:**
    *   **Selectivity:** Choose only the best, most informative images for the entire project page. Less is more.
    *   **Consistency:** Aim for a similar style and aspect ratio for images where appropriate, especially within image grids if you choose to use one for a specific "gallery" like section (though the preference is one image per section).
    *   *(Refer to `artour.html`'s "UI Design Screens" for an example of a clean image grid, but remember the "few key images" and "one image per section" advice first).*

7.  **Conciseness and Visual Forwardness (Overall):**
    *   **Ruthlessly cut text:** Every sentence should add value. If it's not crucial, remove it.
    *   **Prioritize visuals:** Let your images and the (single) video do most of the talking.
    *   **Visitor behavior:** Remember, users will likely spend only a minute or two per project. Make it easy for them to get the essence quickly.

8.  **Maintain the "ARTour" Tidiness:**
    *   While you're making these content and structure changes, keep the general aesthetic of `artour.html` in mind (clean layout, good use of whitespace, clear typography).
    *   The goal is to apply this tidiness *to the new, more concise structure*.

**End Goal for Each Project Page:** A short, visually compelling page that highlights the best of the project quickly, using a prominent video, a brief overview, 3-4 focused sections with minimal text and one strong image each, and an overall clean design.
